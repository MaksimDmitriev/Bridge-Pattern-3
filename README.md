# Bridge-Pattern-3

// Displays can be:
// 1. Monochrome and color
// 2. LCD and LED
// 3. For TV sets, computers, and medical devices

// The Bridge pattern is applied when TWO orthogonal dimensions exist in the domain. Here I have three, and suppose there
// can be more. That's why I applied the Builder pattern instead of Bridge.
